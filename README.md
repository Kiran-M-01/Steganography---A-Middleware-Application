# 🖼️ StegoHide - Steganography-Based Secure Message Hiding System  
### MERN Stack | Image Steganography (LSB Method)**

This project implements a **secure message-hiding system** using **Image Steganography**, built using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js)** and **Cloudinary** for image handling.

The system allows users to securely **hide secret text messages inside images** using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** technique and can generate a downloadable **stego image** that visually looks identical to the original. The hidden
message can be extracted only using the correct decoding mechanism.

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

This application demonstrates the concept of **digital steganography**, where confidential information is hidden inside a digital medium (image) in a way that prevents detection.

Users can:

- 📝 Encode text inside an image  
- 🖼️ Download the stego image  
- 🔍 Decode hidden messages  
- ☁️ Upload images to cloud storage (Cloudinary)  
- 📊 Manage stored data via Admin Panel  
- 🔐 Hide data instead of just encrypting it

## 🔐 **How Steganography Works (LSB Method)**

The project uses the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** algorithm:

1. Every image pixel = 3 color channels (R, G, B)  
2. Each channel has 8 bits  
3. The *last bit (LSB)* of each channel is replaced with message bits  
4. Human eyes cannot detect the 1-bit change → image looks the same  
5. Reversing the process extracts the hidden message  

**Capacity Formula:**  
```
Maximum text = (Total Pixels × 3) / 8  characters
```

## 📩 OTP Verification using Gmail App Password

This project includes a secure **OTP (One-Time Password) email verification system** powered by **Gmail App Passwords**.

### How It Works
- Backend generates a 6-digit OTP.
- OTP is emailed via Gmail SMTP using Nodemailer.
- OTP auto-expires after a short time.
- User is verified only if OTP matches.

### Why Gmail App Password?
- Normal Gmail passwords are blocked by Google for SMTP.
- App Password enables secure backend email sending.
- Works only when 2FA is enabled.
